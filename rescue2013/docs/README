Robocup Rescue Simulation League software version 1.0
=====================================================

Requirements
============
To run this software you will need Java 1.6. To compile it you will also need Ant 1.7 with the script task installed.

Some simulators will only run in Linux, so if you have Windows then unfortunately you're out of luck for now with those simulators. You can still run the kernel, agents and Java simulators (fire and traffic) and the viewer.

Quickstart guide for the impatient
==================================
Enter the boot directory and run "demo.sh". That was easy!

Guided tour of the package
==========================
There are a bunch of directories in this archive:

boot
build-tools
docs
jars
lib
maps
modules
oldsims

The boot directory contains startup scripts for the simulators: start.sh and demo.sh. Demo.sh starts a sample map with sample agents; start.sh is what you probably want to use in real life.

Build-tools contains tools used by the build system (only present in the source distribution).

Docs contains useful documentation.

Jars contains the compiled code.

Lib contains third party libraries.

Maps contains several sample map directories.

Modules contains the source code for all parts of the system (only present in the source distribution).

Oldsims contains the legacy simulators that have not yet been ported to Java.

There is also an Ant build script: build.xml. Once you run Ant there will be a build directory. This directory can be safely deleted if you like.

Developing simulators and agents
================================
Please read the wiki (http://www.robocuprescue.org/wiki/index.php?title=Rescue_Agents#Simulator_Development_and_Documentation and http://www.robocuprescue.org/wiki/index.php?title=Version_1) for instructions on how to build and develop the system.
